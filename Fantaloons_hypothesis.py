Problem:
    Fantaloons Sales managers commented that % of males versus females walking into the store differ based on day of the week. 
    Analyze the data and determine whether there is evidence at 5 % significance level to support this hypothesis.

#H0=Null Hypothesis: there is  no significant differance between male and female at whole week
#H1=Alternative hypothesis: there is significant differance between male and female at whole week

'''
Since the p-value (8.54e-05) is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
based on the analysis, we can conclude that there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the percentage of males versus females 
walking into the Fantaloons store differs based on the day of the week.
