Problem:
    Telecall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. 
    They audit a certain % of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective 
    and must be reworked before processing. The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by center. 
    Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences

'''
Since the p-value (0.2771) is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
based on the analysis, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference 
in the defective percentage among the four centers.
